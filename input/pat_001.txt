MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN  WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, B-DATE :.  TECHNIQUE:  T1 weighted sagittal, proton density and T2 weighted axial, FLAIR axial and diffusion images in axial plane were obtained.  T2 weighted sequences were repeated in axial, coronal and sagittal planes following intravenous injection of contrast.  FINDINGS: A small smoothly contoured intensely enhancing focal lesion is again demonstrated in the medial aspect of the right temporal fossa, most consistent witha meningioma.  Reports were reviewed on multiple prior MR studies of the brain, most recent dated B-DATE, and it does not appear that there is significant interval change in this finding.  Some surrounding edema is again demonstrated as well, again described on the previous reports as well.  The lesion measures approximately 1.3 cm in maximum diameter.  Mild- moderate generalized cerebral atrophy is demonstrated. A mild degree of chronic white matter changes are seen in the periventricular white matters of both hemispheres.  No focal abnormalities are seen.  CONCLUSIONS: 1.  Mild- moderate generalized cerebral atrophy.  Mild degree of chronic white matter changes. 2 .  Approximately 1.3 cm focal lesion in the medial aspect of the right temporal fossa, with MR characteristics most consistent witha meningioma.  Based on prior reports, no significant changes in the size and characteristics of this lesion.
